## Credits

Thanks to:

- The [Omega](https://getomega.dev/) fork of [Epsilon](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon/) for its [template to create native apps](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega-App-Template).
- The [NumWorks.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/numworks.js) npm library, to let everyone upload firmwares through the browser and access storage data (Python programs)
